COMP20
Lab 9
Sophia Wang

1. The purpose of this git repository is to manage and store the assignments and labs completed over the course of COMP 20 Spring semester 2017.

2. My favorite assignment in COMP 20 was assignment 4--creating the server for NotUber. Although this was the toughest assignment (in my opinion), I thought it was the rewarding because we implemented both the client side and server side for the application.

3. I think I have grown a lot in terms of knowledge about the web, about the internet, about what exactly the internet and web pages are, and just programming techniques in general.

4. The most important thing I learned in this course is how the web, which I use thoughtlessly all day everyday, functions. Although I still have a lot to learn about web programming, this class was very insightful for me because before this class I had very little clue as to what goes on in the backend of a website when you type in a URL and press enter. For example, now I know the basics of how to create my own webpage with simple HTML and simple javascript and I know what the different sections of a URL means and how to parse URLs. 

5. I would like to delve deeper into how backend and server-side things work. I also want to learn more about and just spend more time on how to create web pages that look more appealing to the users.
